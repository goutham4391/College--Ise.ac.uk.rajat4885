Typically, companies manage risk by building defence mechanisms to prepare for and lessen the effect of threats. They do so by hiring the best talent, for instance. Or by putting into place certain structures and processes to incentivise that talent and reward it for risk-taking. But mitigation alone has its limitations. Getting more proactive about risk means getting ahead of it. It means leading risk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThink about how people function in your organisations. How do they make decisions? What information do they use? Does information flow up from the different echelons as well as down? The visibility of information and its movement up, as well as down, outside as well as inside businesses is key to making better decisions at every level of the organisation &ndash; decisions that align effectively to strategic goals.

Leadership is about being positively proactive about creating the environment and the structures and processes where information flows with great transparency up and down and across the business, so that people can understand the risks they are engaging with at every level and make informed decisions about those risks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETake the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995 &ndash; a good (or bad) example of what happens when companies are not transparent and aligned enough in the ways that they engage with risk. Trader Nick Leeson was able to make $1.3bn in unauthorised deals without his superiors having visibility of what he was doing. The mechanisms they had put in place were not sufficient to withstand the impact when those deals were called in. There was simply too much residual risk for the bank to manage.

Business is never static, and as situations evolve and change so too do threats and challenges. This is the second tenet of risk leadership. Revisiting risk needs to happen often. And it needs to be transparent. Leaders should prioritise creating an environment where people can speak up without fear of personal risk, of being ostracised for raising a potentially unpopular point of view.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EAnd then, keep taking care of staff\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA key dimension of all of this is supporting and empathising with workers; caring for them and prioritising their well-being during difficult times.

And staff will do so willingly if they know that they have been heard, that they have been kept up to speed, and that that they have been taken care of during this period.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}],"readingTime":"3 min read","buttonPrimary":[{"buttonText":"Download programme brochure","externalLink":"https:\u002F\u002Flseportal.force.com\u002Fexternal\u002Fs\u002Fssei\u002Frequest-info?type=brochure&courseCode=SSEE906","asset":null,"internalLink":null}],"relatedArticles":[{"entryTitle":"AI and business: How what you put in shapes what you get out","entryDescription":"Find out both how to transform businesses with AI as well as the associated risks","sys":{"id":"7e7353a0-adf8-4b90-939b-0cdcd818cc1c","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Fai-and-business-how-what-you-put-in-shapes-what-you-get-out"}},{"entryTitle":"From conflict to win-win: how to negotiate more effectively","entryDescription":"Find out the six things to proactively achieve better outcomes for you and your company","sys":{"id":"fd8e4209-c36b-4583-a3cf-a740bc5a35c3","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Ffrom-conflict-to-win-win-how-to-negotiate-more-effectively"}},{"entryTitle":"How to make good strategic decisions under uncertainty and time pressure","entryDescription":"Avoiding irrational decision traps can help us make better choices in times of crisis and acute risk","sys":{"id":"ee42f507-86cf-4fc1-b340-21e9ea3c29c7","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Fhow-to-make-good-strategic-decisions-under-uncertainty-and-time-pressure"}}],"meta":{"facebookImage":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG"}}},"twitterImage":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG"}}},"metaTitle":"Risky times call for a new type of leadership article","metaImage":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG"}}},"metaDescription":"Find out how to lead risk in these unprecedented times of uncertainty for businesses across the globe with three facets of risk leadership: information flow, communication and taking care of staff."},"subjectArea":[{"entryTitle":"Leadership","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"4d5adf49-b15b-4d4b-8fe2-65a652ab5d90","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"subjectArea","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}},{"entryTitle":"Management","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"263f1450-6356-458e-ae30-c48dd9bb504b","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"subjectArea","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}}],"publishedDate":"2020-10-23T00:00:00","thumbnailImage":{"altText":"Illustration of business leader struggling to hold up blocks","transformations":"crop=301,480,466,0","caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG?crop=301,480,466,0"}}},"entryTitle":"Risky times call for a new type of leadership"},{"image":{"altText":"Black and white graphic showing different graphs ","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"readingsigns-1-resized","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"133d39b6-21cc-46ff-8bf9-a4d9d0176118","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Freadingsigns-1-resized.xecb15244.jpg"}}},"author":[{"entryTitle":"Martin Oehmke","entryDescription":"Martin Oehmke is a Professor of Finance at the LSE.

It&rsquo;s a way of measuring how bond investors feel about the economy &ndash; whether they expect the economy to get better or worse in the years ahead. When the yield curve inverts, it means that longer-term interest rates have fallen below short-term interest rates, a sign that investors expect the economic outlook to worsen. And that a recession could well be on the horizon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHistorically, inverted yield curves have been fairly reliable harbingers of economic woes.

This isn&rsquo;t as challenging as it sounds. A good place to start is to dig a little deeper into how yields are determined and what they reflect. For example, one reason why long-term yields can be low is that investors expect low future interest rates. Another is that investors demand a relatively small premium to bear future interest risk.

At this time, it is more important than ever that our leaders make the right decisions to safeguard health and economic wellbeing. However, human beings are prone to errors when making decisions in unpredictability. And it&rsquo;s to do with the way our brains are wired to make inferences about our world and assess risk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAround 20 years ago the University of Chicago ran a lab experiment to see what people choose to do when faced with risk. One group of participants was told they had a 1% chance of getting an electric shock &ndash; a short, painful but non-dangerous blast of electricity. A second group was told they had a 99% chance of getting the same shock.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth groups were allocated a small sum of money and were asked what they would be prepared to pay in order to avoid these risks. The first group was prepared to pay $7 to avoid their 1% chance of the electric shock. Curiously, the group with the 99% chance of getting the shock was only willing to pay $3 more than their peers.

What it means is that although we are presented with clear data and we can cognitively do the maths, our brains are not naturally configured to instinctively assess probability and then integrate it into our decision making. In situations of uncertainty, we are more likely to miscalculate risk and make mistakes. To be calibrated, we need to use a more explicit decision process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFast forward to September 11 2001. The terrible events in the US give us insight into a second decision-trap that is at play these days. Research by renowned behavioural scientist, Gerd Gigenerenzer, demonstrates that in the wake of the terrorist attacks, US citizens exhibited an irrational fear (behavioural scientists call it &ldquo;dread&rdquo;) of flying. Avoiding planes led to a significant uptick in people travelling by car in 2002. The result was an increase in reported car accidents that year &ndash; no fewer than 1500 were killed, adding substantially to the death toll for 9\u002F11.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same phenomenon occurred in the UK in 2005, following the London transport bombings. Research by Peter Ayton and his colleagues at City University and ourselves at the LSE found that in the six months after the attacks, more Londoners were taking their bicycles to work to avoid public transport. Again, the number of fatalities on the road significantly increased, with 214 people killed on their bikes in traffic accidents &ndash; about 15% more than in the previous year.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"type":"image","value":{"altText":"An illustration of a woman facing different pathways","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"thumbnail":null,"keywords":null,"altText":null,"entryDescription":null,"description":null,"sys":{"owner":"HOUGHMD","metadata":{"includeInAToZ":false,"includeInSearch":true,"includeInSiteMap":false,"includeInMenu":false,"nodeId":"903021c9-667d-43cb-b2b5-1a426b3e9121"},"dataFormat":"asset","isPublished":false,"availableLanguages":["en-GB"],"contentTypeId":"image","language":"en-GB","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Fstrategicdecisions-1-resized.x996b75cd.jpg","version":{"publishedBy":"ServicesUser","archived":null,"deleted":null,"createdBy":"ServicesUser","created":"2021-02-03T10:54:23.1216868Z","versionNo":"2.0","modified":"2021-02-16T16:38:01.243471Z","modifiedBy":"ServicesUser","published":"2021-02-16T16:38:01.321596Z","archivedBy":null,"deletedBy":null},"versionStatus":"published","id":"903021c9-667d-43cb-b2b5-1a426b3e9121","projectId":"executiveEducation","slug":null,"properties":{"filename":"strategicdecisions-1-resized.jpg","fileSize":301266,"width":1440,"fileId":"903021c9-667d-43cb-b2b5-1a426b3e9121","height":776}},"title":"strategicdecisions-1-resized","entryTitle":"strategicdecisions-1-resized"}}},{"type":"content","value":"\u003Cp\u003EThis decision trap is known as dread risk bias.

Grappling with this kind of complexity, leaders should take as broad and integrated a view as possible of the entirety of their organisation &ndash; what it stands for, and how to lead it in terms of its position, sector and strategy.

Typically, companies manage risk by building defence mechanisms to prepare for and lessen the effect of threats. They do so by hiring the best talent, for instance.

Getting more proactive about risk means getting ahead of it. It means leading risk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThink about how people function in your organisations. How do they make decisions? What information do they use? Does information flow up from the different echelons as well as down? The visibility of information and its movement up, as well as down, outside as well as inside businesses is key to making better decisions at every level of the organisation &ndash; decisions that align effectively to strategic goals. And these are the core tenets of what we call risk leadership.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERisk leadership is not the same as risk mitigation &ndash; or even risk management, for that matter. Leadership is about being positively proactive about creating the environment and the structures and processes where information flows with great transparency up and down and across the business, so that people can understand the risks they are engaging with at every level and make informed decisions about those risks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETake the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995 &ndash; a good (or bad) example of what happens when companies are not transparent and aligned enough in the ways that they engage with risk. Trader Nick Leeson was able to make $1.3bn in unauthorised deals without his superiors having visibility of what he was doing. The mechanisms they had put in place were not sufficient to withstand the impact when those deals were called in. There was simply too much residual risk for the bank to manage.

Business is never static, and as situations evolve and change so too do threats and challenges. This is the second tenet of risk leadership. Revisiting risk needs to happen often.

Leaders should prioritise creating an environment where people can speak up without fear of personal risk, of being ostracised for raising a potentially unpopular point of view.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EAnd then, keep taking care of staff\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA key dimension of all of this is supporting and empathising with workers; caring for them and prioritising their well-being during difficult times.

And it&rsquo;s something that none of us can avoid. Whether it&rsquo;s determining the terms of a new deal, overcoming conflict with colleagues or partners, or settling a dispute, negotiating is part of the day-to-day dynamic of our professional lives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn negotiations, every party has distinct interests and perspectives, and every party wants to perform well and walk away from the negotiation table with as many resources as possible.

Familiarise yourself with the counterparty and build rapport\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore actual negotiations begin, you can make effort to get parties working together by finding out more about your counter-party. Seek out your social networks or use social media to begin to better understand your counter party. Perhaps you can discover their general negotiation style and behaviour, what motivates them, and what their interests are. You might find out from others in your networks the dynamic and outcomes of your counter-party&rsquo;s previous negotiations, how they interact and what gets them engaged and wanting to work with others. Simply picking up the phone or meeting the individual (virtually or in person) could help to initiate trust building n the relationship. Even if trust only extends to establishing ground rules and processes, at least you will be moving towards an environment where both parties feel a greater degree of comfort.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E2. Get into their shoes (and walk around in them a bit)\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, getting a good sense of what the other person&rsquo;s interests and desires are and trying to understand their perspective &ndash; even if you don&rsquo;t agree with them &ndash; will help you to be more cognitively present and hopefully facilitate a more rational, understanding discussion. Being invested in finding out more and really understanding the other party can signal to that counter-party that you are at least listening to them, which in turn might lead to you being heard and better understood also. When both parties in a negotiation are able to see and share perspective, they&rsquo;re more likely to feel equally invested. The right information can be shared and the right questions asked to facilitate creating joint value. Understanding where people are coming from and listening effectively can aid you in finding potential trade-offs or thinking of issues to bring to the table, so that you might move the negotiation and counter-party forward to a integrative solution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E3. Share information\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EConstructive negotiation is all about reciprocity. Taking the initiative to share first (and being willing to make yourself vulnerable) can get this exchange going and also help anchor the conversation in your favour. Perhaps your willingness to share will help nudge more difficult negotiating partners into following your lead and opening up the dialogue from their side. When people at the table see that all sides are willing to work together and build a collaborative rhythm or flow, it can sustain positive exchange and foster parties sharing the right information to create value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E4. Prioritise creativity\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn any negotiation, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter unexpected issues or elements as you delve deeper in your discussions. This is where you are going to need to get creative about everyone&rsquo;s interests and really look outside the box for options and solutions that meet everyone&rsquo;s needs. An important part of your creativity is preparing for the negotiation and understanding your counter-parties in advance. Mapping out your perception of everyone&rsquo;s interests prior to negotiating can help you to initially think of creative solutions from various perspectives. Take a fresh look at what makes the other party tick and then try to bring this to the table in someway. Think about the issues on the table and brainstorm whether the issues have potential to be multi-faceted. If there are several facets to the issues, unbundle them &ndash; this gives you more issues on the table to discuss and more options to get to a creative and value-generating solution. Use creativity to engage them in a more integrative and mutually beneficial exchange. Be willing to adjust your assumptions and creativity as you ask the right questions and learn more from the new information you retrieve from your counter-party. Establishing an environment where parties are working together and co-creating can be fruitful in terms of generating multiple ideas for potential solutions, and leading to an eventual buy-in and agreement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E5. Be collective\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrame your conversation as collective instead of individual so that it fosters a we working together dynamic, instead of a me focus. Using positive affect or niceties can facilitate more prosocial or helpful behaviours and actions. If you have examples of integrative or win-win outcomes from previous negotiations, why not share these experiences and this expertise? But be careful. Coming across as having expertise can help you be perceived as powerful, but coming over as patronising will not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E6. Minimise threat\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf threats are used by the individuals who don&rsquo;t want to create value, find ways to block or prevent these threats from occurring. Creating positive affect at the table can help to de-escalate the tension. Find an issue that you both care about and agree to it, so that you can move the negotiation forward positively. Recognising the implicit players at the table might also help your case. You may be able to get all players to switch their tactics by involving these implicit players and garnering their influence. Ultimately, your opponents&rsquo; BATNAs (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) give them power. If you can discover what this is and figure out how to move their BATNA in your favour, maybe you can get these difficult party or parties on board and working with everyone else at the table.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}],"readingTime":"5 min read","buttonPrimary":[{"buttonText":"Download programme brochure","externalLink":"https:\u002F\u002Flseportal.force.com\u002Fexternal\u002Fs\u002Fssei\u002Frequest-info?type=brochure&courseCode=SSEE903","asset":null,"internalLink":null}],"relatedArticles":[{"entryTitle":"How to make good strategic decisions under uncertainty and time pressure","entryDescription":"Avoiding irrational decision traps can help us make better choices in times of crisis and acute risk","sys":{"id":"ee42f507-86cf-4fc1-b340-21e9ea3c29c7","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Fhow-to-make-good-strategic-decisions-under-uncertainty-and-time-pressure"}},{"entryTitle":"Risky times call for a new type of leadership","entryDescription":"Mitigating risk in these times isn’t enough – you need to lead it","sys":{"id":"42479b67-fa42-48ca-8679-fbd5b7a74fec","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Frisky-times-call-for-a-new-type-of-leadership"}},{"entryTitle":"Building your competitive strategy?

And it&rsquo;s something that none of us can avoid. Whether it&rsquo;s determining the terms of a new deal, overcoming conflict with colleagues or partners, or settling a dispute, negotiating is part of the day-to-day dynamic of our professional lives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn negotiations, every party has distinct interests and perspectives, and every party wants to perform well and walk away from the negotiation table with as many resources as possible. Things can get even more complicated when you are negotiating with colleagues or business partners who are particularly competitive or who routinely negotiate in a non-integrative (or less win-win) context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how do you navigate negotiation to ensure that you reach the best agreements, concessions and outcomes for you and your business?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are six things that top negotiators know and proactively do to achieve better outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E1. Familiarise yourself with the counterparty and build rapport\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore actual negotiations begin, you can make effort to get parties working together by finding out more about your counter-party. Seek out your social networks or use social media to begin to better understand your counter party. Perhaps you can discover their general negotiation style and behaviour, what motivates them, and what their interests are. You might find out from others in your networks the dynamic and outcomes of your counter-party&rsquo;s previous negotiations, how they interact and what gets them engaged and wanting to work with others. Simply picking up the phone or meeting the individual (virtually or in person) could help to initiate trust building n the relationship. Even if trust only extends to establishing ground rules and processes, at least you will be moving towards an environment where both parties feel a greater degree of comfort.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E2. Get into their shoes (and walk around in them a bit)\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, getting a good sense of what the other person&rsquo;s interests and desires are and trying to understand their perspective &ndash; even if you don&rsquo;t agree with them &ndash; will help you to be more cognitively present and hopefully facilitate a more rational, understanding discussion. Being invested in finding out more and really understanding the other party can signal to that counter-party that you are at least listening to them, which in turn might lead to you being heard and better understood also. When both parties in a negotiation are able to see and share perspective, they&rsquo;re more likely to feel equally invested. The right information can be shared and the right questions asked to facilitate creating joint value. Understanding where people are coming from and listening effectively can aid you in finding potential trade-offs or thinking of issues to bring to the table, so that you might move the negotiation and counter-party forward to a integrative solution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E3. Share information\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EConstructive negotiation is all about reciprocity. Taking the initiative to share first (and being willing to make yourself vulnerable) can get this exchange going and also help anchor the conversation in your favour. Perhaps your willingness to share will help nudge more difficult negotiating partners into following your lead and opening up the dialogue from their side. When people at the table see that all sides are willing to work together and build a collaborative rhythm or flow, it can sustain positive exchange and foster parties sharing the right information to create value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E4. Prioritise creativity\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn any negotiation, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter unexpected issues or elements as you delve deeper in your discussions. This is where you are going to need to get creative about everyone&rsquo;s interests and really look outside the box for options and solutions that meet everyone&rsquo;s needs. An important part of your creativity is preparing for the negotiation and understanding your counter-parties in advance. Mapping out your perception of everyone&rsquo;s interests prior to negotiating can help you to initially think of creative solutions from various perspectives. Take a fresh look at what makes the other party tick and then try to bring this to the table in someway. Think about the issues on the table and brainstorm whether the issues have potential to be multi-faceted. If there are several facets to the issues, unbundle them &ndash; this gives you more issues on the table to discuss and more options to get to a creative and value-generating solution. Use creativity to engage them in a more integrative and mutually beneficial exchange. Be willing to adjust your assumptions and creativity as you ask the right questions and learn more from the new information you retrieve from your counter-party. Establishing an environment where parties are working together and co-creating can be fruitful in terms of generating multiple ideas for potential solutions, and leading to an eventual buy-in and agreement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E5. Be collective\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrame your conversation as collective instead of individual so that it fosters a we working together dynamic, instead of a me focus.

Ultimately, your opponents&rsquo; BATNAs (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) give them power.

Getting more proactive about risk means getting ahead of it. It means leading risk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThink about how people function in your organisations. How do they make decisions?

And staff will do so willingly if they know that they have been heard, that they have been kept up to speed, and that that they have been taken care of during this period.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}],"readingTime":"3 min read","buttonPrimary":[{"buttonText":"Download programme brochure","externalLink":"https:\u002F\u002Flseportal.force.com\u002Fexternal\u002Fs\u002Fssei\u002Frequest-info?type=brochure&courseCode=SSEE906","asset":null,"internalLink":null}],"relatedArticles":[{"entryTitle":"AI and business: How what you put in shapes what you get out","entryDescription":"Find out both how to transform businesses with AI as well as the associated risks","sys":{"id":"7e7353a0-adf8-4b90-939b-0cdcd818cc1c","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Fai-and-business-how-what-you-put-in-shapes-what-you-get-out"}},{"entryTitle":"From conflict to win-win: how to negotiate more effectively","entryDescription":"Find out the six things to proactively achieve better outcomes for you and your company","sys":{"id":"fd8e4209-c36b-4583-a3cf-a740bc5a35c3","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Ffrom-conflict-to-win-win-how-to-negotiate-more-effectively"}},{"entryTitle":"How to make good strategic decisions under uncertainty and time pressure","entryDescription":"Avoiding irrational decision traps can help us make better choices in times of crisis and acute risk","sys":{"id":"ee42f507-86cf-4fc1-b340-21e9ea3c29c7","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"article","dataFormat":"entry","uri":"\u002Fstudy-at-lse\u002Fexecutive-education\u002Finsights\u002Farticles\u002Fhow-to-make-good-strategic-decisions-under-uncertainty-and-time-pressure"}}],"meta":{"facebookImage":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG"}}},"twitterImage":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG"}}},"metaTitle":"Risky times call for a new type of leadership article","metaImage":{"altText":"","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG"}}},"metaDescription":"Find out how to lead risk in these unprecedented times of uncertainty for businesses across the globe with three facets of risk leadership: information flow, communication and taking care of staff."},"subjectArea":[{"entryTitle":"Leadership","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"4d5adf49-b15b-4d4b-8fe2-65a652ab5d90","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"subjectArea","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}},{"entryTitle":"Management","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"263f1450-6356-458e-ae30-c48dd9bb504b","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"subjectArea","dataFormat":"entry","uri":null}}],"publishedDate":"2020-10-23T00:00:00","thumbnailImage":{"altText":"Illustration of business leader struggling to hold up blocks","transformations":"crop=301,480,466,0","caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"Risky times image","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"bbe31544-235b-4419-8a9b-86ebc67d2ef8","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Farticle-images\u002FRisky-times-image.x6f7ea05d.PNG?crop=301,480,466,0"}}},"entryTitle":"Risky times call for a new type of leadership"},{"image":{"altText":"Graphic of an executive holding a tablet with graphs overlaying it","transformations":null,"caption":"","asset":{"entryTitle":"competitivestrategy-1-resized","entryDescription":null,"sys":{"id":"4fa32049-fb8f-48fb-8480-a04176bb582b","language":"en-GB","contentTypeId":"image","dataFormat":"asset","uri":"\u002Fexec-image-library\u002Fcompetitivestrategy-1-resized.x8d50c254.jpg"}}},"author":[{"entryTitle":"Lourdes Sosa","entryDescription":"Dr Lourdes Sosa joined LSE as Associate Professor.

And fail so spectacularly?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong other things, the reason likely lies in a simple mistake that businesses and decision-makers frequently make.
